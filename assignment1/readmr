Assignment 1 — Books to Read

CP1404/CP5632 – IT@JCU
By: Yasir Foysol Rahib

Project Overview

This project is a command-line Python program for managing a personal reading list.
It allows the user to:

Load and display books from a CSV file

Add new books with validation

Mark books as completed

Save all changes back to the file upon exit

The program focuses on clean function design, input validation, and user-friendly output formatting, following the principles of modular programming and code readability.

Repository Contents
File	Description
assignment1.py	Main Python program implementing all required functionality
books.csv	Primary data file storing all book information (title, author, pages, status)
books_backup.csv	Backup copy of the original CSV data (not used by the program)
README.md	This file — project documentation and reflection
 How It Works

When the program starts, it loads data from books.csv.

The main menu lets users choose to:

D – Display all books (sorted by author and title)

A – Add a new book (validated for blank or invalid input)

C – Mark an unread book as completed

Q – Save all changes and quit

The program automatically updates books.csv when quitting, ensuring all modifications persist.

 Development Reflection

How long did the entire project take?
Approximately 6–7 hours in total — including understanding the requirements, writing and testing the code, fixing formatting issues, and setting up Git/GitHub for version control.

What will you do differently for Assignment 2?
For Assignment 2, I plan to:

Start the project earlier to have more time for testing and refinement.

Write small pieces of code and test them immediately before moving to the next part.

Commit changes more frequently with clear messages.

Use consistent formatting and comments from the start to keep the code cleaner.
